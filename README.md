# Web Form Filler

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of filling web forms using data from a CSV file. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the Selenium library for browser automation.

## Features

1. **CSV Data Integration**: Parse a CSV file and populate corresponding fields on a target web page.
2. **Dynamic Web Pages**: Support dynamic web pages with JavaScript-based interactions.
3. **Flexible Field Mapping**: Customize field mapping between CSV data and web form to handle different data formats.
4. **Error Handling**: Handle error cases gracefully and provide informative logging for troubleshooting.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies: BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the script by specifying the target web page URL, CSV file path, and field mappings.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script and watch as it automatically fills the web form.

This project serves as a starting point for automating repetitive data entry tasks on web forms. Feel free to modify and enhance the script to suit your specific needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
