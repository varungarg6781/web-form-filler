Web Form Filler

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of filling web forms using data from a CSV file. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the Selenium library for browser automation.

Features:
- Parses a CSV file containing form data and populates the corresponding fields on a target web page
- Supports dynamic web pages with JavaScript-based interactions
- Provides flexibility to customize field mapping between the CSV file and web form
- Handles error cases and provides informative logging for troubleshooting

Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies: BeautifulSoup and Selenium
2. Configure the script by specifying the target web page URL, CSV file path, and field mappings
3. Run the script and watch as it automatically fills the web form

This project serves as a starting point for automating repetitive data entry tasks on web forms. Feel free to modify and enhance the script to suit your specific needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
